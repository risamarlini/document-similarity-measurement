BFS 
-Complete Yes (if b is finite)  
-Time 1 +   +   2 +   3 +   +     =  (   d ) 
-	Space  (   d ) 
-	Optimal Yes (if cost = 1 per step).  
-	Implementation:       : FIFO (Queue)

DFS 
-	Complete No: fails in infinite-depth spaces    complete in finite spaces  
-	Time       : 1 +   +   2 +   3 +   +     =   (    ) 
–Space   (????) linear space complexity 
-	Optimal No 
-	Implementation: fringe: LIFO (Stack)

UCS 
 
-Complete Yes, if solution has a finite cost.  
-	Time 
•	Suppose     : cost of the optimal solution 
•	Every action costs at least   (bound on the cost)  
•	The effective depth is roughly    /  (how deep the cheapest solution could be). •        /  • 
 -Space # of nodes with   = cost of optimal solution,        /   
- Optimal Yes  
-Implementation: fringe = queue ordered by path cost  ( ), lowest first = Heap!
